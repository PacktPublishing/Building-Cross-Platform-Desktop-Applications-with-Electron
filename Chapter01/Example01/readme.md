# Hello Electron

This is a hello world example of electron. This just prints the electron, chrome and node version of underlying electron shell into the page. But it gives a basic skeleton to render a page into the electron shell.

## Running the application

First you need to install the dependencies using npm or yarn. Enter the following command in your terminal.

Using npm: ```npm install```
Using yarn: ```yarn```

Once your dependencies are installed, you can run the application using the following command.

```electron .```

If you don't have the electron in your path, use the electron module installed locally in the application. In this case, use the following command to run the application.

```./node_modules/.bin/electron```

On Windows machine you may have to wrap the command with the quotation mark as follows

```"./node_modules/.bin/electron"```
